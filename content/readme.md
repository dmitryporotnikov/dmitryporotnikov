## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work for Microsoft as an Azure Escalation Engineer. I specialize in system administration and virtualization, but as side projects and hobbies, I also dabble in IT security and coding (C#/C/Python).

I enjoy learning new technologies and sharing this knowledge with my peers. I'm a total nerd and computer geek, passionate about industry advancements in ARM silicon, AI, machine learning, and cloud computing.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning JavaScript/Go and algorithms at Boot.Dev.
