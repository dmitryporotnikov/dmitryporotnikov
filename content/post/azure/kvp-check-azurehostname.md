## Check if two Azure VMs are on the same physical host

Have you ever wondered if your Azure workloads are located on the same physical host? Imagine you're facing a strange issue, and after checking everything on your end, you notice that only a subset of virtual machines is affected. Could the Azure host be the culprit? Maybe, maybe not. Should you re-deploy?

Fortunately, you can check whether two VMs are located on the same host using the good old Hyper-V Data Exchange protocol.

**For Windows:**

$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Virtual Machine\Guest\Parameters"
$hostName = Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "PhysicalHostName"
$hostName.PhysicalHostName
```
