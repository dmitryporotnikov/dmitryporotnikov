## Free OPNsense Firewall NVA in Azure

I’ve stumbled upon this GitHub repository that’s pretty awesome. It’s got a deployment script that lets you run OPNSense Community Edition in Azure for free.  
  
If you’re into firewalls, networking, or just like trying out new tech stuff, this GitHub repository is worth a glance. It’s fun, it’s free, and it’s a playground for anyone interested in what OPNSense can do in Azure.

Here’s the [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/dmauser/opnazure) if you want to check it out.
